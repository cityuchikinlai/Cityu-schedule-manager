# Cityu-schedule-manager
A software aims to provide insights for students at City University of Hong Kong to assist them in making informed decisions when arranging their courses. Especially for those who intend to add new course or modify the session of their pre-registered courses.

## How to use it?
Simply create a text file containing all the information of your pre-registered courses except the sessions that you cannot register. Please ensure that the formatting adheres to the provided sample file, named "me.txt." Next, replace the my.txt with the url of text file you have created. Finally, execute the Main file, which will provide you with essential information regarding "occupied sessions" at specific timeslots. Here "occupied sessions" means sessions that you must not drop this session unless you want to drop the whole course because other sessions are unavaliable. 

## Upcoming update
The current software implementation lacks user-friendliness, making it challenging to apply in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, a web crawler for aims will be incorporated, automating the generation of the text file. Additionally, a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) will be designed to enhance the overall user experience.
